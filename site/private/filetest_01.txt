What is Ruby? How do I get started? What’s this “Ruby On Rails”? All good questions, which I shall answer in good time. Put simply, Ruby is a fully object-oriented, interpreted programming language. It was developed some fifteen years ago by Yukihiro Matsumoto, and the underlying philosophy was to develop something that was enjoyable to use, and that abided by the “principle of least astonishment” (POLA). Unlike say, Java, Ruby is dynamically typed (and famously makes use of “duck typing” which I will cover in a future post). All you need know for now is that it’s pretty bloody nifty, and a welcome change from the verbosity of Java!

Naturally I have now convinced you to try it, so let’s start at the very beginning and set up the ole’ development environment. I’m working in OS X, but the command line stuff will be the same for everyone (you should be comfortable with firing up a terminal window and issuing the odd command, editing text files etc.) Windows users must not fret: there is a popular installer for your platform which does everything required to provide a functional command line interface for Ruby (oh, and don’t panic about all this mention of “command lines”: we won’t be doing anything esoteric).
